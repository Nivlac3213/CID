# CID
Cellular Intrusion Detection System

In secure and restricted environments, it is a standard expectation for employees to adhere to stringent mobile phone storage policies, mandating the safe storage or removal of phones from designated areas. In cases where individuals inadvertently retain their phones or seek to exploit this trust, the CID system outlined in this document proposes an innovative solution. The systemâ€™s primary function is to locate and classify intruding cellular devices within secure areas for relaying to security professionals. This capability is achieved through the utilization of advanced cellular carrier signal detection technology, ensuring and elevated level of security and reliability within confined spaces.

Ther core objectives of the CID system include the detection and triangulation of designated cellular signals regardless of frequency band and the classification of intruding signal type including but not limited to LTE, Bluetooth, WiFi, and Near-Field Communication (NFC). Sensor data processing and machine learning are utilized to accurately locate and classify intruding cellular device signals. A machine learning algorithm is essential to combat the growing trend of cellular products that may operate outside of designated frequency bands or exhibit unconventional behaviors designed to evade traditional security measures. This advanced approach ensures an elevated level of security and reliability within confined spaces and addresses the evolving nature of security challenges, providing an effective and tailored solution for government IT and security professionals.
